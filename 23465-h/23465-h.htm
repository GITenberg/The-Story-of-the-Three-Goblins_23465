<h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF" id="THE_STORY_OF"></a>THE STORY OF THE THREE GOBLINS.</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there were three
little goblins.</p>

<p>Their names were Red-Cap, Blue-Cap
and Yellow-Cap, and they lived in a
mountain.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/i-007.jpg" width="424" height="600" alt="" title="frog whose name was Rowley" />
</div>

<p>The goblins had a great friend&mdash;a green
frog whose name was Rowley.</p>

<p>Rowley came every year to see the
little goblins, and told them stories about
the Big World where he lived.</p>


<p>The goblins had never seen the Big
World, and often asked their father to let
them go with Rowley, but he always said,
&ldquo;Not yet, my sons.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The name of the goblins' father was
Old Black-Cap.</p>

<p>He was King of the Mountain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i-015.jpg" width="374" height="600" alt="" title="Old Black-Cap called the three goblins" />
</div>

<p>At last, one day Old Black-Cap called
the three goblins and said to them: &ldquo;I
am going to send you into the Big World
to look for something which the fairies
stole from me a long time ago. A Red
Feather which always belongs to the King
of the Mountain. Go, my sons, and the
one who finds it shall be king of this
mountain after me.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/i-018.jpg" width="352" height="600" alt="" title="the white thing rolled away" />
</div>

<p>Red-Cap, Blue-Cap and Yellow-Cap
said good-bye to their father and climbed
out into the Big World through a rabbit
hole. When they had gone a little way
they saw something lying on the ground.
Something large and white and round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; they all cried together.</p>

<p>Red-Cap, who was the eldest, got inside
it to see what it was made of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; cried Blue-Cap and Yellow-Cap.
&ldquo;It is moving! Stop! Stop!&rdquo; But
the white thing rolled away down the
mountain with poor little Red-Cap inside
it; faster and faster it went, and Blue-Cap
and Yellow-Cap were left quite behind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/i-023.jpg" width="375" height="600" alt="" title="Bump! Splash!" />
</div>

<p>Now little Red-Cap was a brave goblin,
but he was rather frightened when the
White Thing began to roll so fast. He
wondered if it would ever stop, when&mdash;Bump!
Splash!&mdash;he found he was in the
water, and something big with a smooth
coat was close beside him. It was a kind
water-rat who had seen the poor little
goblin roll into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can swim,&rdquo; said Mr. Rat. &ldquo;I will
hold you by the collar and take you to
dry land again.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/i-026.jpg" width="372" height="600" alt="" title="Red-Cap thanked the kind water-rat" />
</div>

<p>Red-Cap thanked the kind water-rat
very much, and they sat down on the
bank of the stream to rest. Red-Cap
told the rat all about his father and brothers
and the Red Feather, and soon
Blue-Cap and Yellow-Cap came running
up, quite out of breath, but very glad to
find their brother quite safe and not even
scratched.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i-031.jpg" width="344" height="600" alt="" title="They all soon said good-bye to the rat" />
</div>

<p>They all soon said good-bye to the rat,
who wished them good luck, showed them
the road and told them to look in a tree&mdash;which
he pointed out&mdash;where he said
they would find something which would
help them very much.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/i-034.jpg" width="383" height="600" alt="" title="The goblins raced to the tree" />
</div>

<p>The goblins raced to the tree. Yellow-Cap
won the race and climbed up quickly,
while the others ran all round looking to
see what they could find.</p>

<p>They found nothing, and Yellow-Cap
was just coming down again when he spied
a bird's-nest with three dear little blue eggs
in it. He crawled along the branch to
look at the eggs, and saw something white
under the nest. Yellow-Cap pulled it
gently, and out came an envelope. Full
of joy he slipped down to his brothers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>They opened the envelope and found a
sheet of paper on which was written in
gold letters,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">&ldquo;You who seek the Feather Red</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">First the Serpent's blood must shed;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In the cave where fairies dwell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The Feather lies, so search it well.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Red-Cap. &ldquo;Let us
make haste and find the cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon they came to a big dark forest,
and after they had gone a little way they
saw a fence and a large board on which
was written in red letters,&mdash;</p>

<div class="centerbox bbox">
<h4>
TOM TIDDLER'S<br />
GROUND<br />
<br />
TRESPASSERS<br />
WILL BE<br />
PROSECUTED.<br />
</h4></div>

<p>The goblins looked over the fence and
saw that the ground was covered with gold
and silver!</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/i-039.jpg" width="368" height="600" alt="" title="&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; they cried" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;let us fill our
pockets. What fun!&rdquo; and they began to
climb over the fence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/i-042.jpg" width="360" height="600" alt="" title="They all got safely down" />
</div>

<p>They all got safely down on the other
side, and seeing no one about they began
to fill their pockets with the shining money,
singing, &ldquo;We are on Tom Tiddler's ground,
picking up gold and silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a big rough voice
say, &ldquo;Yes, you are on Tom Tiddler's
ground, and Tom Tiddler will lock you
all up, you little thieves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The goblins dropped their handfuls of
gold and silver, and found themselves
caught up by a great big giant who carried
them off, with great long strides, to
his house.</p>

<p>Tom Tiddler took them into a large
kitchen where Mrs. Tiddler was busy
making the tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;But these goblins in
the pantry, and we will have them fried
on toast for breakfast.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 357px;">
<img src="images/i-047.jpg" width="357" height="600" alt="" title="only stopping to fill a sack" />
</div>


<p>The poor little brothers were locked up
in the pantry, and they sat down on the
floor holding each others hands very tight
and shaking with fear.</p>

<p>At last they grew bolder, and began to
think how they could get away. They
tried to open the window, and found to
their joy that Tom Tiddler had forgotten
to lock it. They crept out very quietly
and climbed down by the thick ivy which
grew up the wall.</p>

<p>The goblins ran as fast as they could,
only stopping to fill a sack which they
had found with gold and silver. They
knew that Tom Tiddler and his wife were
at tea, and would not think of coming out
for some time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/i-050.jpg" width="353" height="600" alt="" title="jump on my back I will give you a lift" />
</div>

<p>The brothers managed, after a great
deal of hard work, to get the sack over
the fence, and as it was too heavy to drag
with them they agreed to bury it in the
forest and dig it up as they came back.</p>

<p>Just when they were ready a rabbit
came up to them. &ldquo;Hullo, little chaps,&rdquo;
said the rabbit, &ldquo;where are you off to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are on our way to the fairies'
cave,&rdquo; they replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a long way to go yet,&rdquo; said
the rabbit; &ldquo;the cave is on an island in
the sea; but I am going that way, and if
you jump on my back I will give you a
lift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little brothers thanked the rabbit
very much, as they were feeling tired after
their hard work. As soon as they were
safely seated the rabbit started off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>On and on they went until they had
left the dark forest far behind, and were
on the sea-shore. Here the rabbit stopped,
saying, &ldquo;I can take you no farther; you
have now to cross the water, and must
consult the Great Fish. He will appear
if you knock three times on the rock.
Take also this red dust, you will find it
useful;&rdquo; and putting a little bag of red
dust into Red-Cap's hand the rabbit ran
off.</p>

<p>The goblins did as the rabbit had told
them, and when they had knocked three
times on a rock a large fish raised itself
slowly out of the water and said, &ldquo;Why
have you called me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please will you tell us how to get to
the fairies' cave?&rdquo; said Blue-Cap.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">&ldquo;Look between the rocks so green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">There a boat will soon be seen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In the boat you all must sail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Wafted gently by the gale.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>said the fish, and sank again beneath the
blue waves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

</div>


<p>The brothers, after looking about for a
little while, found a white boat between
two big rocks covered with green seaweed.
They pulled it out and got in, and no
sooner had they sat down than a gentle
wind sprang up and blew them steadily
out to sea. They were rather frightened
as they had never been on the sea before,
but soon they saw that they were coming
to land. The land proved to be an island,
and when the boat stopped on the yellow
sand the goblins all jumped out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/i-063.jpg" width="370" height="600" alt="" title="dragon which breathed fire" />
</div>

<p>They made the boat fast by tying the
rope to a large piece of rock, and feeling
that their hardest work was coming walked
bravely over the sands, carrying a boat-hook
which they had found in the boat.</p>

<p>They soon came to a dark cave in the
rocks. In front of the cave was a big
dragon which breathed fire out of its mouth
and roared like hundreds of lions. The
goblins, after trying many times, managed
to creep over the rocks behind the dragon,
and throwing the dust which the rabbit
had given them into its flaming eyes they
at last, after a hard fight, killed the monster
and entered the cave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">
<img src="images/i-066.jpg" width="377" height="600" alt="" title="The goblins looked round in the darkness" />
</div>

<p>The goblins looked round in the darkness
for the serpent of which they had
heard, but they could not find it.</p>

<p>At last, when they were sadly thinking
of going back to the boat, Red-Cap cried
out that he saw something yellow in the
dark shadow of a rock.</p>

<p>It was the serpent's tail!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i-071.jpg" width="369" height="600" alt="" title="It was the serpent&#39;s tail" />
</div>

<p>They all ran after it, shouting loudly,
and it led them some way down a rocky
passage.</p>

<p>It went very quickly, and they had to
run very fast to keep it in sight; but at
last they caught it, and after a sharp
struggle&mdash;in which poor little Red-Cap
nearly lost his life&mdash;killed it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The three little brothers stood looking
at the dead serpent, and while they were
looking it seemed to change! It moved!
and grew thinner and darker, and the
bright yellow colour turned to orange,
and from orange colour to red, and then
redder! and redder!! and redder!!! until
they saw&mdash;that it was no longer the serpent,
but the Red Feather for which they
had come so far to look!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment a bright light seemed
to shine, and standing near the goblins
was a lovely lady.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<img src="images/i-079.jpg" width="386" height="600" alt="" title="&ldquo;Goblins,&rdquo; she cried" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Goblins,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;welcome to the
cave of the fairies. Long have I waited
for this happy day, when my kingdom
should be once more restored to me. You
must know that many years ago the wicked
wizard, Tom Tiddler, cast over me a cruel
spell. I and my people were forced to
leave our fairy isle, and wander in the
shape of birds in the Big World. We were
told that never would the spell be broken
until three goblins should enter the cave
in search of a feather. We therefore stole
your Royal Red Feather, and hid it in our
cave. No sooner had we done so than the
cruel wizard turned it into a yellow serpent
and put a terrible dragon at the entrance
of the cave. Our friend Rowley the frog
told your father that we had stolen the
feather, and as soon as you were old enough
we gave you the wish to undertake this
journey. But for your courage I should
still be in Tom Tiddler's power. In return
for your bravery I now charm your Red
Feather. Henceforth any goblin holding
it in his hand shall have his wish&mdash;whatever
it may be&mdash;granted.&rdquo; As the Princess
said these words she touched the Feather
with her wand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i-082.jpg" width="363" height="600" alt="" title="and started for home" />
</div>

<p>The goblins thanked the lovely Princess
many times, and asked her to send for
them at once if they could ever help her.
They then took leave of the fairies and
started for home.</p>

<p>They sailed again over the sea and
found the rabbit waiting for them. They
jumped on the rabbit's back and off they
went. When they got to the place where
they had left the sack of gold and silver
they found it had been dug up ready for
them, and standing by it was a big blue
bird with a red beak and red legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump on,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I will pull
you; I am Pukeko,[A] the fairies' servant,
sent to take you back to the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">[A] New Zealand Swamp-hen.</span></p>


<p>They thanked the kind rabbit, and jumping
on the sack went on their way. They
had not gone far when they heard a great
noise behind them, and looking round saw
Tom Tiddler trying hard to catch them.</p>

however, Blue-Cap pointed the Red
Feather at him, and said, &ldquo;I wish you
to become a snail!&rdquo; and Tom Tiddler
turned at once into a crawling snail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can never hurt any one again,&rdquo;
the goblins cried with joy. &ldquo;His treasure
now is ours. Hurrah!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sons,&rdquo; said he, taking them
in his arms, &ldquo;the kingdom is yours. Rule
it well together, as together you have
found the Feather. I am an old man

<p>Old Black-Cap and his sons gave a

and they all enjoyed it very much and
lived happily ever after.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
